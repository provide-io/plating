# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Plating is a documentation generation system for Terraform/OpenTofu providers. It automatically generates Terraform Registry-compliant documentation by discovering components via pyvider.hub and processing Jinja2 templates.

## Development Setup

### Environment Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository (if not already done)
git clone https://github.com/provide-io/plating.git
cd plating

# Create virtual environment
uv venv

# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies with dev extras
uv sync --extra dev
# Or for editable install:
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### Running Tests
```bash
uv run pytest tests                  # Run all tests
uv run pytest tests/test_cli.py      # Run specific test file
uv run pytest -k test_adorn          # Run tests matching pattern
uv run pytest -xvs                   # Stop on first failure, verbose output
```

### Code Quality
```bash
uv run ruff format src/plating tests    # Format code
uv run ruff check src/plating tests     # Check linting
uv run mypy src/plating                 # Type checking
```

## Architecture

### Core Components

**PlatingBundle System** (`plating.py`)
- Central abstraction representing a `.plating` directory containing documentation assets
- Each bundle maps to a provider component (resource, data_source, or function)
- Structure: `component_name.plating/` with `docs/` (templates) and `examples/` (Terraform files)

**Discovery System** (`plating.py:PlatingDiscovery`)
- Searches installed packages for `.plating` directories
- Uses `provide.foundation.hub` for component discovery
- Supports multi-component bundles (subdirectories within .plating)

**Template Processing** (`templating/engine.py`)
- Async-only rendering pipeline using Jinja2
- Custom template functions: `schema()`, `example()`, `include()`, `render()`
- Processes provider schema from foundation hub component discovery
- Uses `run_in_executor` for blocking file I/O operations

**Schema Extraction** (`schema/processor.py`)
- Extracts provider schemas via foundation.hub component discovery
- Converts component schemas to markdown documentation
- Handles resources, data sources, and functions differently

**Test Runner** (`test_runner.py`)
- Executes terraform init/apply/destroy on example files
- Sequential execution only

### Key Design Patterns

1. **Absolute Imports**: All imports use `from plating.X import Y` (no relative imports)

2. **Attrs for Data Classes**: Uses `@attrs.define` instead of dataclasses

3. **Foundation Integration**:
   - Uses `provide.foundation.hub` for component discovery
   - Uses `provide.foundation` for logging (`pout`, `perr`, `logger`)
   - Requires pyvider-cty for type handling

4. **Async-Only Design**: All rendering and I/O operations are async
   - Uses `asyncio.to_thread()` and `run_in_executor()` for blocking file operations
   - No synchronous API - async is the only supported interface

## Important Dependencies

- **provide.foundation**: Core foundation services
  - `foundation.hub`: Component discovery and registry
  - `foundation` output functions: `pout`, `perr`, `logger`
  - Resilience patterns: retry, circuit breaker, metrics
- **pyvider-cty**: Type handling for Terraform/OpenTofu schemas
- **attrs**: Data class definitions (design choice, not dataclasses)
- **Jinja2**: Template engine for documentation rendering
- **rich**: Terminal UI formatting (via foundation)

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding New Template Functions
1. Add function to `template_functions.py`
2. Register in `TemplateEngine` class
3. Update `async_renderer.py` to include in env.globals

### Testing Plating Commands
```bash
# Test without installation
python -m plating.cli --help
python -m plating.cli adorn --component-type resource
python -m plating.cli plate --output-dir docs
```

### Working with Sibling Packages
If pyvider packages are in sibling directories:
```bash
uv pip install -e ../pyvider-components
uv pip install -e ../pyvider-telemetry
# etc.
```

## Testing Philosophy

- CLI tests mock the underlying functions
- Focus on unit testing individual components
- Integration tests use mocked dependencies

## Known Limitations

1. Test runner supports sequential execution only - no parallel execution
2. Tightly coupled to pyvider ecosystem for component discovery
3. No plugin system for alternative schema extractors

# Contributing to Plating

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Plating! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributors.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

Plating uses [UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for Python environment and package management.

#### Install UV

**macOS and Linux:**
```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows:**
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

### Getting Started

1. **Fork and clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/provide-io/plating.git
   cd plating
   ```

2. **Set up development environment:**
   ```bash
   uv venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
   # or .venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
   uv sync
   ```

3. **Verify installation:**
   ```bash
   python -m plating.cli --help
   uv run pytest tests/ -v

   # Note: 2 tests may be skipped if optional dependencies are not installed
   # This is expected behavior and not a problem
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Code Quality

We maintain high code quality standards with automated tools:

```bash
# Format code
uv run ruff format src/plating tests

# Check linting
uv run ruff check src/plating tests

# Type checking
uv run mypy src/plating

# Run all quality checks
uv run pytest tests/
```

### Code Style Guidelines

- **Python Version:** 3.11+
- **Line Length:** 111 characters
- **Type Hints:** Modern typing (`dict`, `list`, `set` instead of `Dict`, `List`, `Set`)
- **Import Style:** Absolute imports (`from plating.X import Y`)
- **No Hardcoded Defaults:** Use `defaults.py` or `constants.py` for configuration values

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest tests/

# Run specific test file
uv run pytest tests/test_cli.py

# Run with coverage
uv run pytest tests/ --cov=plating --cov-report=html

# Run tests matching pattern
uv run pytest -k test_adorn
```

### Architecture Guidelines

1. **PlatingBundle System:** Core abstraction for `.plating` directories
2. **Async-First Design:** Primary renderer is async with sync adapters
3. **Attrs for Data Classes:** Use `@attrs.define` instead of `@dataclass`
4. **Pyvider Integration:** Leverage hub for component discovery
5. **Error Handling:** Use `provide.foundation` patterns

First, create `.plating` bundles for your undocumented components:

```bash
# Adorn all missing components
plating adorn

# Adorn only resources
plating adorn --component-type resource
```

### 2. Customize Templates

Edit the generated templates in `.plating/docs/`:

```markdown
---
page_title: "Resource: my_resource"
---

# my_resource

{{ "{{ example('basic') }}" }}

## Schema

{{ "{{ schema() }}" }}
```

### 3. Generate Documentation

Render your documentation:

```bash
# Generate docs in ./docs directory
plating plate

# Custom output directory
plating plate --output-dir ./documentation
```

## 📂 Bundle Structure

Each component has a `.plating` bundle:

```
my_resource.plating/
├── docs/
│   ├── my_resource.tmpl.md    # Main template
│   └── _partial.md             # Reusable partials (optional)
├── examples/
│   ├── basic.tf                # Example configurations
│   ├── advanced.tf             # (optional)
│   └── full_stack/             # Grouped examples (optional)

```

**Note:** The `examples/` directory can contain:
- `.tf` files for resources/data sources (flat examples)
- `.py` files for Python API examples
- Subdirectories with `main.tf` for grouped examples that combine multiple components

## 🎨 Template Functions

Plating provides powerful template functions:

- `{{ "{{ schema() }}" }}` - Render component schema as markdown table
- `{{ "{{ example('name') }}" }}` - Include an example file in a terraform code block
- `{{ "{{ include('filename') }}" }}` - Include a static partial file
- `{{ "{{ render('filename') }}" }}` - Render a dynamic template partial with current context

## 🔍 Validation

Validate your generated documentation:

```bash
# Validate all documentation
plating validate

# Validate in custom directory
plating validate --output-dir ./documentation
```

## 🛡️ Foundation Integration

Plating is built on provide.foundation patterns for enterprise-grade reliability:

- **🔄 Automatic Retries**: Built-in retry policies with exponential backoff for I/O operations
- **📊 Metrics & Observability**: Integrated performance tracking and operation metrics
- **⚡ Circuit Breakers**: Prevents cascading failures in distributed systems
- **📝 Structured Logging**: Foundation logger integration with contextual information
- **🚀 Async-First Design**: High-performance async operations throughout

## 🔧 Advanced Usage

### Filter to Specific Package

By default, Plating searches all installed packages for components. You can filter to a specific package:

```bash
plating adorn --package-name pyvider.components
plating plate --package-name pyvider.components
```

### Generate Executable Examples

Generate standalone executable Terraform examples alongside documentation:

```bash
plating plate --generate-examples
```

Customize example output directories:

```bash
plating plate --generate-examples \
  --examples-dir examples/ \
  --grouped-examples-dir examples/integration/
```

## 🔧 Configuration

Configure Plating in your `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.plating]
# Provider name (auto-detected if not specified)
provider_name = "my_provider"
```

**Note:** Currently only `provider_name` can be configured in `pyproject.toml`. Other options like `output_dir` and `component_types` must be passed as CLI flags:

```bash
plating plate --output-dir docs --component-type resource
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

Plating follows a modular architecture:

- **PlatingBundle** - Represents documentation bundles
- **PlatingPlater** - Renders documentation
- **PlatingAdorner** - Creates documentation templates
- **PlatingDiscovery** - Finds components and bundles
- **SchemaProcessor** - Extracts provider schemas

    }
}
```

**Note:** This is a synchronous method, not async.

### PlatingContext

Configuration context for plating operations. This is an alias for `PlatingCLIContext` which extends foundation's `CLIContext`.

```python
from plating import PlatingContext

# Common usage with basic parameters
context = PlatingContext(
    provider_name="my_provider",
    log_level="INFO",
    no_color=False
)
```

#### Constructor Parameters

**Commonly Used Parameters:**
- `provider_name`: Provider name (required for most operations)
- `log_level`: Logging level (`"DEBUG"`, `"INFO"`, `"WARNING"`, `"ERROR"`)
- `no_color`: Disable colored output
- `debug`: Enable debug mode
- `json_output`: Output in JSON format

**Additional Parameters (from PlatingCLIContext):**

#### Methods

##### to_dict()

Convert context to dictionary for template rendering.

```python
def to_dict(include_sensitive: bool = False) -> dict[str, Any]
```

**Parameters:**
- `include_sensitive`: Whether to include sensitive values

##### load_context()

Load context from file.

```python
@classmethod
def load_context(cls, path: Path) -> PlatingContext
```

**Parameters:**
- `path`: Path to context file

**Returns:** PlatingContext instance

**Note:** The methods are `save_context()` and `load_context()`, not `save()` and `load()`.

### PlatingBundle

Represents a documentation bundle.

```python
# Recommended: Import from main package (exported as ModularPlatingBundle)
from plating import ModularPlatingBundle as PlatingBundle
from pathlib import Path

# Or import directly from bundles module
from plating.bundles import PlatingBundle
from pathlib import Path

bundle = PlatingBundle(
    name="my_resource",
    plating_dir=Path("my_resource.plating"),
    component_type="resource"
)
```

**Note:** The main package exports this as `ModularPlatingBundle`, but you can import it directly from `plating.bundles` as `PlatingBundle`.

#### Properties

- `name`: Component name
- `plating_dir`: Bundle directory path
- `component_type`: Component type identifier
- `docs_dir`: Documentation templates directory

def load_partials() -> dict[str, str]
```

**Returns:** Dictionary of partial templates

##### has_main_template()

Check if bundle has main template.

```python
def has_main_template() -> bool
```

##### has_examples()

Check if bundle has examples.

```python
def has_examples() -> bool
```

## Result Types

### AdornResult

Result from adorn operations.

```python
@define
class AdornResult:
    components_processed: int = 0
    templates_generated: int = 0
    examples_created: int = 0
    errors: list[str] = field(factory=list)

    @property
    def success(self) -> bool:
        """Whether the operation succeeded."""
        return len(self.errors) == 0
```

**Note:** `AdornResult` does not track duration because adorning is primarily a fast, metadata-focused operation. `PlateResult` tracks duration because template rendering can be time-intensive with many components, and users may want to monitor performance for optimization purposes.

### PlateResult

Result from plate operations.

```python
@define
class PlateResult:
    bundles_processed: int = 0
    files_generated: int = 0
    duration_seconds: float = 0.0
    errors: list[str] = field(factory=list)
    output_files: list[Path] = field(factory=list)

    @property
    def success(self) -> bool:
        """Whether the operation succeeded."""
        return len(self.errors) == 0
```

### ValidationResult

Result from validation operations with markdown linting support.

```python
@define
class ValidationResult:
    total: int = 0
    passed: int = 0
    failed: int = 0
    skipped: int = 0
    duration_seconds: float = 0.0
    failures: dict[str, str] = field(factory=dict)  # Maps file paths to error messages
    errors: list[str] = field(factory=list)  # General errors
    lint_errors: list[str] = field(factory=list)  # Markdown linting errors
    terraform_version: str = ""

    @property
    def success(self) -> bool:
        """Whether all validations passed."""
        return self.failed == 0 and len(self.lint_errors) == 0 and len(self.errors) == 0
```

**Note:** `failures` is a dictionary mapping file paths to error messages, not a list of objects.

## Component Types

Enumeration of component types.

```python
from plating.types import ComponentType

ComponentType.RESOURCE      # Terraform resources
ComponentType.DATA_SOURCE   # Data sources
ComponentType.FUNCTION      # Provider functions
ComponentType.PROVIDER      # Provider configuration
```

**Properties:**
- `display_name`: Formatted display name
- `output_subdir`: Output directory name

## Error Classes

### PlatingError

Base exception for all plating errors.

```python
class PlatingError(Exception):
    def to_user_message() -> str
    def to_dict() -> dict[str, Any]
```

### Specific Errors

```python
BundleError         # Bundle-related errors
PlatingRenderError  # Template rendering errors
SchemaError         # Schema extraction errors
AdorningError       # Component adorning errors
FileSystemError     # File system operations
TemplateError       # Template processing errors
ValidationError     # Documentation validation errors
```

## Template Functions

Functions available in Jinja2 templates.

### schema()

Render component schema as markdown table.

```jinja2
{{ schema() }}
```

**Output:** Markdown table with columns: Argument, Type, Required, Description

### example(name)

Include example file.

```jinja2
{{ example("basic") }}
```

**Parameters:**
- `name`: Filename without extension

**Output:** Example wrapped in code block

### include(filename)

Include static partial.

```jinja2
{{ include("_note.md") }}
```

**Parameters:**
- `filename`: Partial filename

**Output:** Raw partial content

### render(filename)

Render dynamic partial.

```jinja2
{{ render("_section.md") }}
```

**Parameters:**
- `filename`: Partial filename

**Output:** Processed partial with context

## Foundation Integration

Plating includes foundation patterns:

### Retry Policy

```python
RetryPolicy(
    max_attempts=3,
    backoff=BackoffStrategy.EXPONENTIAL,
    base_delay=0.5,
    max_delay=10.0,
    retryable_errors=(IOError, OSError, TimeoutError, ConnectionError)
)
```

### Metrics

Operations tracked:
- `adorn`: Adorning duration
- `plate`: Generation performance
- `validate`: Validation time
- `template_render`: Rendering metrics

### Logging

```python
from provide.foundation import logger, pout, perr

logger.info("Processing", component="my_resource")
pout("✅ Success")
perr("❌ Error")
```

## Async Operations

All operations are asynchronous:

```python
import asyncio

async def main():
    context = PlatingContext(provider_name="my_provider")
    api = Plating(context)

    # Async methods must be awaited
    result = await api.adorn()
    result = await api.plate()
    result = await api.validate()

    # get_registry_stats is synchronous
    stats = api.get_registry_stats()

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Registry Access

Access the component registry:

```python
# Get components by type (returns list[PlatingBundle])
resources = api.registry.get_components(ComponentType.RESOURCE)

# Get specific component (returns PlatingBundle | None)
resource = api.registry.get_component(
    ComponentType.RESOURCE,
    "my_resource"
)

# Get documented components (returns list[PlatingBundle])
documented = api.registry.get_components_with_templates(
    ComponentType.RESOURCE
)
```

**Registry Methods:**
- `get_components(component_type: ComponentType) -> list[PlatingBundle]`
- `get_component(component_type: ComponentType, name: str) -> PlatingBundle | None`
- `get_components_with_templates(component_type: ComponentType) -> list[PlatingBundle]`

## Complete Example

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
import asyncio
from pathlib import Path
from plating import Plating, PlatingContext
from plating.types import ComponentType

async def generate_documentation():
    # Configure
    context = PlatingContext(
        provider_name="my_provider",
        log_level="INFO"
    )

    # Initialize
    api = Plating(context, package_name="pyvider.my_provider")

    # Generate templates
    adorn_result = await api.adorn(
        component_types=[ComponentType.RESOURCE]
    )

    if adorn_result.templates_generated > 0:
        print(f"Created {adorn_result.templates_generated} templates")

    # Generate documentation (validation runs automatically with validate_markdown=True)
    plate_result = await api.plate(
        output_dir=Path("docs"),
        validate_markdown=True,
        force=True
    )

    if not plate_result.success:
        for error in plate_result.errors:
            print(f"Error: {error}")
        return False

    print(f"Generated {plate_result.files_generated} files")

    # Optional: Run standalone validation if you need additional checks
    # validate_result = await api.validate(output_dir=Path("docs"))
    # print(f"Validation: {validate_result.passed}/{validate_result.total}")

    return plate_result.success

if __name__ == "__main__":
    success = asyncio.run(generate_documentation())
    exit(0 if success else 1)

# Plating API Documentation

This document provides comprehensive API documentation for the Plating documentation generation system.

## Core Classes

### PlatingBundle

Represents a single `.plating` bundle containing documentation assets.

```python
from plating.bundles import PlatingBundle
from pathlib import Path

bundle = PlatingBundle(
    name="my_resource",
    plating_dir=Path("my_resource.plating"),
    component_type="resource"  # or "data_source", "function", "provider"
)
```

#### Properties

- `docs_dir: Path` - Directory containing documentation templates and partials
- `examples_dir: Path` - Directory containing example files (.tf or .py)
- `fixtures_dir: Path` - Directory containing test fixtures and data files

#### Methods

- `load_main_template() -> str | None` - Load the main template file
- `load_examples() -> dict[str, str]` - Load all example files as dictionary
- `load_partials() -> dict[str, str]` - Load partial files (starting with `_`)

### Plating (Main API)

The primary API for all plating operations. This is the recommended way to interact with plating.

```python
import asyncio
from plating import Plating, PlatingContext
from plating.types import ComponentType
from pathlib import Path

async def main():
    # Initialize plating API with context
    context = PlatingContext(
        provider_name="my_provider",
        log_level="INFO",
        no_color=False
    )
    api = Plating(context, package_name="pyvider.components")

    # Adorn components with templates
    result = await api.adorn(component_types=[ComponentType.RESOURCE])
    print(f"Generated {result.templates_generated} templates")

    # Generate documentation
    result = await api.plate(output_dir=Path("docs"))
    print(f"Generated {result.files_generated} files")

    # Validate documentation
    result = await api.validate(output_dir=Path("docs"))
    print(f"Validated {result.total} files")

# Run the async function
asyncio.run(main())
```

### PlatingContext

Configuration context for plating operations with foundation integration.

```python
from plating import PlatingContext

context = PlatingContext(
    provider_name="my_provider",
    log_level="INFO",           # Logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
    no_color=False,             # Disable colored output
    verbose=False,              # Enable verbose output
    quiet=False                 # Suppress non-error output
)
```

#### Methods

- `adorn(output_dir, component_types, templates_only)` - Generate template structure for components
- `plate(output_dir, component_types, force, validate_markdown, project_root)` - Generate documentation from plating bundles
- `validate(output_dir, component_types, project_root)` - Validate generated documentation
- `get_registry_stats()` - Get registry statistics for all components

All methods are async and should be awaited.

## Template Functions

Plating provides custom Jinja2 template functions for documentation generation.

### schema()

Renders the component schema as a markdown table with attributes, types, and descriptions.

```jinja2
## Arguments

{{ schema() }}
```

**Output:** Generates a markdown table with columns: Argument, Type, Required, Description

### example(name)

Includes an example file by name from the examples directory, wrapped in a terraform code block.

```jinja2
### Basic Usage

{{ example("basic") }}
```

**Parameters:**
- `name` - Filename (without .tf extension) from the bundle's examples/ directory

**Output:** Returns the example wrapped in triple-backtick terraform code block

### include(filename)

Includes a static partial file from the docs directory without processing.

```jinja2
{{ include("_common_note.md") }}
```

**Parameters:**
- `filename` - Name of partial file in the bundle's docs/ directory

**Output:** Raw content of the partial file

### render(filename)

Renders a dynamic template partial with the current template context.

```jinja2
{{ render("_dynamic_section.md") }}
```

**Parameters:**
- `filename` - Name of partial file in the bundle's docs/ directory

**Output:** The partial file processed as a Jinja2 template with full access to context variables (name, type, schema, examples, etc.)

## CLI Interface

### Commands

#### adorn

Create `.plating` bundles for components missing documentation.

```bash
# Adorn all missing components
plating adorn

# Adorn specific component types
plating adorn --component-type resource
plating adorn --component-type data_source
plating adorn --component-type function

# Multiple component types
plating adorn --component-type resource --component-type function

# Filter to specific package
plating adorn --package-name pyvider.components

plating adorn --provider-name my_provider
```

#### plate

Generate documentation from `.plating` bundles.

```bash
# Generate to default directory (auto-detected)
plating plate

# Custom output directory
plating plate --output-dir ./documentation

# Filter to specific component types
plating plate --component-type resource --component-type data_source

# Filter to specific package
plating plate --package-name pyvider.components

# Force overwrite existing files
plating plate --force

# Disable validation
plating plate --no-validate

# Specify project root (auto-detected if not provided)
plating plate --project-root /path/to/project

# Generate executable examples alongside documentation
plating plate --generate-examples

# Customize example output directories
plating plate --generate-examples \
  --examples-dir examples/ \
  --grouped-examples-dir examples/integration/
```

#### validate

## Error Handling

Plating provides structured error handling with custom exception types.

### Exception Hierarchy

- `PlatingError` - Base error for all plating operations
  - `BundleError` - Bundle-related errors
  - `PlatingRenderError` - Template rendering errors
  - `SchemaError` - Schema extraction/processing errors
  - `AdorningError` - Component adorning errors
  - `FileSystemError` - File system operation errors
  - `TemplateError` - Template processing errors
  - `ValidationError` - Documentation validation errors

### Error Handling Example

```python
from plating.errors import (
    PlatingError,
    BundleError,
    PlatingRenderError,
    AdorningError,
    FileSystemError,
    TemplateError,
    SchemaError,
    ValidationError
)

try:
    result = await api.plate(output_dir)
except TemplateError as e:
    logger.error(f"Template processing failed: {e}")
except FileSystemError as e:
    logger.error(f"File system error: {e}")
except PlatingRenderError as e:
    logger.error(f"Rendering failed: {e}")
except BundleError as e:
    logger.error(f"Bundle error: {e}")
except PlatingError as e:
    logger.error(f"Plating operation failed: {e}")
```

## Foundation Integration

Plating is built on provide.foundation patterns for enterprise-grade reliability:

### Resilience Patterns

```python
from plating import Plating, PlatingContext

# Plating automatically includes retry policies for I/O operations
context = PlatingContext(provider_name="my_provider")
api = Plating(context)

# Built-in retry policy with exponential backoff
# - Max attempts: 3
# - Base delay: 0.5s
# - Max delay: 10s
# - Retryable errors: IOError, OSError, TimeoutError, ConnectionError
```

### Metrics and Observability

```python
# Plating operations are automatically tracked with foundation metrics
# Operations tracked include:
# - adorn: Component adorning duration and success rate
# - plate: Documentation generation performance
# - validate: Validation execution time
# - template_render: Individual template rendering metrics
```

### Circuit Breaker Pattern

```python
# Circuit breakers prevent cascading failures
# Automatically applied to:
# - Schema extraction operations
# - Template rendering
# - File I/O operations
```

### Structured Logging

```python
from provide.foundation import logger, pout, perr

# All operations use foundation's structured logging
logger.info("Processing component", component_name="my_resource", type="resource")

# User-friendly output
pout("✅ Documentation generated successfully")

# Error output
perr("❌ Failed to generate documentation")
```

## Integration with Pyvider

Plating integrates deeply with the Pyvider ecosystem:

### Component Discovery

```python
from pyvider.hub import ComponentDiscovery, hub

# Discover components
discovery = ComponentDiscovery(hub)
await discovery.discover_all()
components = hub.list_components()
```

### Schema Extraction

```python
# Extract component schema
schema = component.get_schema()
schema_dict = attrs.asdict(schema)
```

### Telemetry Integration

```python
from provide.foundation import logger, pout

# Structured logging
logger.info("Processing component", component_name=name)

# User-friendly output  
pout(f"✨ Adorning {component_name}...")
```

## Testing

### Mocking Components

```python
from unittest.mock import Mock

# Mock component for testing
mock_component = Mock()
mock_component.__doc__ = "Test component documentation"
mock_component.get_schema.return_value = test_schema
```

### Test Utilities

```python
import tempfile
from pathlib import Path

# Create temporary bundle for testing
with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmp_dir:
    bundle_dir = Path(tmp_dir) / "test.plating"
    bundle_dir.mkdir()
    
    # Create test bundle
    bundle = PlatingBundle(
        name="test",
        plating_dir=bundle_dir,
        component_type="resource"
    )
```

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Template Functions

Register custom template functions:

```python
from jinja2 import Environment

def custom_function(value):
    return f"Custom: {value}"

# Add to environment
env = Environment()
env.globals["custom"] = custom_function
```

### Batch Processing

Process multiple providers:

```python
import asyncio
from plating import Plating, PlatingContext

async def process_providers():
    providers = ["aws", "azure", "gcp"]

    for provider in providers:
        context = PlatingContext(provider_name=provider)
        api = Plating(context, package_name=f"pyvider.{provider}")

        # Generate documentation for each provider
        await api.adorn()
        result = await api.plate(Path(f"docs/{provider}"))
        print(f"Generated docs for {provider}: {result.files_generated} files")

asyncio.run(process_providers())
```

### Async Operations

All plating operations are async-first:

```python
import asyncio
from plating import Plating, PlatingContext

async def main():
    context = PlatingContext(provider_name="my_provider")
    api = Plating(context)

    # All operations are async
    adorn_result = await api.adorn()
    print(f"Adorned {adorn_result.templates_generated} components")

    plate_result = await api.plate()
    print(f"Generated {plate_result.files_generated} files")

    validate_result = await api.validate()
    print(f"Validated {validate_result.total} files")

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Bundle Loading**: Lazy loading of templates and examples
- **Schema Caching**: Schema extraction results are cached per session
- **Async Operations**: Component discovery and adorning are async
- **Memory Usage**: Large schemas may consume significant memory during processing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Module Not Found**: Ensure pyvider packages are installed
2. **Schema Extraction Fails**: Check component discovery setup
3. **Template Rendering Errors**: Verify Jinja2 syntax in templates
4. **Missing Bundles**: Run `plating adorn` to create missing documentation

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging:

```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

# Or use provide.foundation
from provide.foundation import logger
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
```

### Validation

Validate bundle structure:

```python
bundle = PlatingBundle(name="test", plating_dir=path, component_type="resource")

# Check required directories exist
assert bundle.docs_dir.exists()
assert bundle.examples_dir.exists()

# Validate template loads
template = bundle.load_main_template()
assert template is not None
```

# Plating API Documentation

This document provides comprehensive API documentation for the Plating documentation generation system.

## Core Classes

### PlatingBundle

Represents a single `.plating` bundle containing documentation assets.

```python
from plating.plating import PlatingBundle

bundle = PlatingBundle(
    name="my_resource",
    plating_dir=Path("my_resource.plating"),
    component_type="resource"
)
```

#### Properties

- `docs_dir: Path` - Directory containing documentation templates and partials
- `examples_dir: Path` - Directory containing example files (.tf or .py)

#### Methods

- `load_main_template() -> str | None` - Load the main template file
- `load_examples() -> dict[str, str]` - Load all example files as dictionary
- `load_partials() -> dict[str, str]` - Load partial files (starting with `_`)

### Plating (Main API)

The primary API for all plating operations. This is the recommended way to interact with plating.

```python
from plating import Plating, PlatingContext
from plating.types import ComponentType
from pathlib import Path

# Initialize plating API with context
context = PlatingContext(provider_name="my_provider")
api = Plating(context, package_name="pyvider.components")

# Adorn components with templates
result = await api.adorn(component_types=[ComponentType.RESOURCE])
print(f"Generated {result.templates_generated} templates")

# Generate documentation
result = await api.plate(output_dir=Path("docs"))
print(f"Generated {result.files_generated} files")

# Validate documentation
result = await api.validate(output_dir=Path("docs"))
print(f"Validated {result.total} files")
```

#### Methods

- `adorn(output_dir, component_types, templates_only)` - Generate template structure for components
- `plate(output_dir, component_types, force, validate_markdown, project_root)` - Generate documentation from plating bundles
- `validate(output_dir, component_types, project_root)` - Validate generated documentation
- `get_registry_stats()` - Get registry statistics for all components

All methods are async and should be awaited.

### PlatingAdorner

Creates documentation templates and examples for components.

```python
from plating.adorner import PlatingAdorner

adorner = PlatingAdorner(package_name="pyvider.components")

# Adorn missing components
results = await adorner.adorn_missing(component_types=["resource"])
print(f"Adorned {results['resource']} resources")
```

#### Methods

- `adorn_missing(component_types: list[str] | None = None) -> dict[str, int]` - Adorn components with missing bundles

**Note:** Internal methods (prefixed with `_`) are not part of the public API and should not be used directly.

### PlatingDiscovery

Discovers `.plating` bundles from installed packages.

```python
from plating.plating import PlatingDiscovery

discovery = PlatingDiscovery(package_name="pyvider.components")
bundles = discovery.discover_bundles(component_type="resource")
```

#### Methods

- `discover_bundles(component_type: str | None = None) -> list[PlatingBundle]` - Discover all bundles

### SchemaProcessor

Handles schema extraction and processing for documentation generation.

```python
from plating.schema import SchemaProcessor

processor = SchemaProcessor(provider_name="aws")
schema = processor.extract_provider_schema()
processor.parse_provider_schema()
```

#### Methods

- `extract_provider_schema() -> dict[str, Any]` - Extract provider schema using Pyvider discovery
- `parse_provider_schema() -> None` - Parse extracted schema into internal structures
- `_parse_schema_to_markdown(schema: dict[str, Any]) -> str` - Convert schema to markdown

## Template Functions

Plating provides custom Jinja2 template functions for documentation generation.

### schema()

Renders the component schema as a markdown table with attributes, types, and descriptions.

```jinja2
## Arguments

{{ schema() }}
```

**Output:** Generates a markdown table with columns: Argument, Type, Required, Description

### example(name)

Includes an example file by name from the examples directory, wrapped in a terraform code block.

```jinja2
### Basic Usage

{{ example("basic") }}
```

**Parameters:**
- `name` - Filename (without .tf extension) from the bundle's examples/ directory

**Output:** Returns the example wrapped in triple-backtick terraform code block

### include(filename)

Includes a static partial file from the docs directory without processing.

```jinja2
{{ include("_common_note.md") }}
```

**Parameters:**
- `filename` - Name of partial file in the bundle's docs/ directory

**Output:** Raw content of the partial file

### render(filename)

Renders a dynamic template partial with the current template context.

```jinja2
{{ render("_dynamic_section.md") }}
```

**Parameters:**
- `filename` - Name of partial file in the bundle's docs/ directory

**Output:** The partial file processed as a Jinja2 template with full access to context variables (name, type, schema, examples, etc.)

## CLI Interface

### Commands

#### adorn

Create `.plating` bundles for components missing documentation.

```bash
# Adorn all missing components
plating adorn

# Adorn specific component types
plating adorn --component-type resource
plating adorn --component-type data_source
plating adorn --component-type function

# Multiple component types
plating adorn --component-type resource --component-type function

# Filter to specific package
plating adorn --package-name pyvider.components

# Explicit provider name (otherwise auto-detected)
plating adorn --provider-name my_provider
```

#### plate

Generate documentation from `.plating` bundles.

```bash
# Generate to default directory (auto-detected)
plating plate

# Custom output directory
plating plate --output-dir ./documentation

# Filter to specific component types
plating plate --component-type resource --component-type data_source

# Filter to specific package
plating plate --package-name pyvider.components

# Force overwrite existing files
plating plate --force

# Disable validation
plating plate --no-validate

# Specify project root (auto-detected if not provided)
plating plate --project-root /path/to/project

# Generate executable examples alongside documentation
plating plate --generate-examples

# Customize example output directories
plating plate --generate-examples \
  --examples-dir examples/ \
  --grouped-examples-dir examples/integration/
```

#### validate

Validate generated documentation.

```bash
# Validate all documentation
plating validate

# Validate in custom directory
plating validate --output-dir ./documentation

# Validate specific component types
plating validate --component-type resource --component-type data_source

# Filter to specific package
plating validate --package-name pyvider.components
```

#### info

Show registry information and statistics.

```bash
# Show registry info with auto-detected provider
plating info

# Show info for specific provider (otherwise auto-detected)
plating info --provider-name my_provider

# Filter to specific package (default: search all installed packages)
plating info --package-name pyvider.components
```

#### stats

```bash
# Show all statistics (searches all installed packages)
plating stats

# Filter to specific package
plating stats --package-name pyvider.components
```

## Configuration

Configure Plating behavior in `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.plating]
# Provider name for schema extraction (auto-detected if not specified)
provider_name = "my_provider"
```

**Important:** Currently only `provider_name` is read from `pyproject.toml`. All other options must be passed as CLI flags:

### CLI-Only Options

| Option | Flag | Commands | Description |
|--------|------|----------|-------------|
| Output directory | `--output-dir PATH` | plate, validate | Where to write/read docs |
| Component types | `--component-type TYPE` | adorn, plate, validate | Filter by type (repeatable) |
| Package filter | `--package-name NAME` | all | Filter to specific package |
| Force overwrite | `--force` | plate | Overwrite existing files |
| Validation | `--validate/--no-validate` | plate | Enable/disable validation |
| Project root | `--project-root PATH` | plate | Specify project root |
| Generate examples | `--generate-examples` | plate | Create executable examples |
| Examples directory | `--examples-dir PATH` | plate | Output dir for examples |
| Grouped examples | `--grouped-examples-dir PATH` | plate | Output dir for integration examples |

## Error Handling

Plating provides structured error handling with custom exception types.

### Exception Hierarchy

- `PlatingError` - Base error for all plating operations
  - `BundleError` - Bundle-related errors
  - `PlatingRenderError` - Template rendering errors
  - `SchemaError` - Schema extraction/processing errors

### Error Handling Example

```python
from plating.errors import PlatingError, BundleError, PlatingRenderError

try:
    plater.plate(output_dir)
except PlatingRenderError as e:
    logger.error(f"Template rendering failed: {e}")
except BundleError as e:
    logger.error(f"Bundle error: {e}")
except PlatingError as e:
    logger.error(f"Plating operation failed: {e}")
```

## Integration with Pyvider

Plating integrates deeply with the Pyvider ecosystem:

### Component Discovery

```python
from pyvider.hub import ComponentDiscovery, hub

# Discover components
discovery = ComponentDiscovery(hub)
await discovery.discover_all()
components = hub.list_components()
```

### Schema Extraction

```python
# Extract component schema
schema = component.get_schema()
schema_dict = attrs.asdict(schema)
```

### Telemetry Integration

```python
from provide.foundation import logger, pout

# Structured logging
logger.info("Processing component", component_name=name)

# User-friendly output  
pout(f"✨ Adorning {component_name}...")
```

## Testing

### Mocking Components

```python
from unittest.mock import Mock

# Mock component for testing
mock_component = Mock()
mock_component.__doc__ = "Test component documentation"
mock_component.get_schema.return_value = test_schema
```

### Test Utilities

```python

from pathlib import Path

# Create temporary bundle for testing
with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as tmp_dir:
    bundle_dir = Path(tmp_dir) / "test.plating"
    bundle_dir.mkdir()
    
    # Create test bundle
    bundle = PlatingBundle(
        name="test",
        plating_dir=bundle_dir,
        component_type="resource"
    )
```

    bundles = discovery.discover_bundles()
    
    plater = PlatingPlater(bundles=bundles, schema_processor=schema_processor)
    plater.plate(Path(f"docs/{provider}"))
```

### Async Operations

All adorning operations are async:

```python
import asyncio

async def main():
    adorner = PlatingAdorner()
    results = await adorner.adorn_missing()
    print(f"Adorned {sum(results.values())} components")

asyncio.run(main())

# Validate template loads
template = bundle.load_main_template()
assert template is not None

# Bundle Discovery Pattern for Foundation

> **Status:** 💡 Proposal
> **Date:** 2025-01-25
> **Implementation:** Not yet started
> **Discussion:** This is a forward-looking proposal for extracting plating's bundle discovery into foundation

## Overview

The `PlatingBundle` and `PlatingDiscovery` patterns from plating are generic and reusable for any packaged asset discovery. This could become a foundation module.

## Proposed Foundation Module: `provide.foundation.discovery`

### Core Classes

```python
@dataclass
class ResourceBundle:
    """Generic resource bundle for any packaged assets."""
    name: str
    bundle_dir: Path
    resource_type: str
    metadata: dict[str, Any] = field(default_factory=dict)
    
    @property
    def assets_dir(self) -> Path:
        """Directory containing assets."""
        return self.bundle_dir / "assets"
    
    @property  
    def config_dir(self) -> Path:
        """Directory containing configuration."""
        return self.bundle_dir / "config"
    
    def load_assets(self) -> dict[str, str]:
        """Load all asset files as string content."""
        # Implementation similar to PlatingBundle.load_examples
        
    def load_metadata(self) -> dict[str, Any]:
        """Load bundle metadata from config files."""
        # Implementation for loading YAML/JSON metadata

class ResourceDiscovery:
    """Discover resource bundles from installed packages."""
    
    def __init__(self, package_pattern: str = "*.resources"):
        self.package_pattern = package_pattern
    
    def discover_bundles(self, resource_type: str | None = None) -> list[ResourceBundle]:
        """Discover all resource bundles from packages."""
        # Generic implementation for any package discovery
        
    def scan_directory(self, directory: Path) -> list[ResourceBundle]:
        """Scan a directory for resource bundles."""
        # Local directory scanning
```

### Usage Examples

```python
# For documentation generation (current plating use case)
from provide.foundation.discovery import ResourceDiscovery, ResourceBundle

discovery = ResourceDiscovery("*.components")  
doc_bundles = discovery.discover_bundles(resource_type="documentation")

# For plugin discovery
plugin_discovery = ResourceDiscovery("*.plugins")
plugins = plugin_discovery.discover_bundles(resource_type="extension")

# For template discovery  
template_discovery = ResourceDiscovery("*.templates")
templates = template_discovery.discover_bundles(resource_type="jinja2")
```

### Benefits

1. **Reusability**: Any project needing asset/resource discovery
2. **Standardization**: Common pattern across provide ecosystem
3. **Extensibility**: Support for different bundle types and metadata formats
4. **Performance**: Caching and optimization opportunities

### Migration Path

1. Extract plating's bundle logic to foundation
2. Update plating to use foundation's discovery module  
3. Provide backward compatibility adapters
4. Document migration guide for other projects

### Implementation Notes

- Support multiple asset directories per bundle
- Flexible metadata loading (YAML, JSON, TOML)
- Plugin hooks for custom bundle types
- Caching layer for performance
- Async discovery support for large package sets

# Template Processing Pipeline for Foundation

> **Status:** 💡 Proposal
> **Date:** 2025-01-25
> **Implementation:** Not yet started
> **Discussion:** This is a forward-looking proposal for extracting plating's template engine into foundation

## Overview

Plating's async template rendering with Jinja2 integration and partials support could become a general-purpose template processing module in foundation.

## Proposed Foundation Module: `provide.foundation.templates`

### Core Classes

```python
from typing import Protocol, runtime_checkable

@runtime_checkable
class TemplateLoader(Protocol):
    """Protocol for template loading strategies."""
    
    async def load_template(self, name: str) -> str:
        """Load template content by name."""
        ...
    
    async def load_partials(self, template_name: str) -> dict[str, str]:
        """Load partial templates related to a template."""
        ...

class AsyncTemplateEngine:
    """Async template processing with partials support."""
    
    def __init__(
        self,
        loader: TemplateLoader,
        engine_type: str = "jinja2",
        global_context: dict[str, Any] = None
    ):
        self.loader = loader
        self.engine_type = engine_type
        self.global_context = global_context or {}
        self._setup_engine()
    
    async def render(
        self, 
        template_name: str, 
        context: dict[str, Any],
        partials: dict[str, str] = None
    ) -> str:
        """Render template with context and partials."""
        # Async implementation with metrics tracking
        
    async def render_batch(
        self, 
        templates: list[tuple[str, dict[str, Any]]]
    ) -> list[str]:
        """Render multiple templates in parallel."""
        # Parallel processing with rate limiting
        
    def add_global_function(self, name: str, func: callable):
        """Add global template function."""
        # Similar to plating's template function registration

class FileTemplateLoader:
    """Load templates from filesystem."""
    
    def __init__(self, template_dirs: list[Path]):
        self.template_dirs = template_dirs
    
    async def load_template(self, name: str) -> str:
        # Find and load template file
        
    async def load_partials(self, template_name: str) -> dict[str, str]:
        # Load related partial templates

class BundleTemplateLoader:
    """Load templates from resource bundles."""
    
    def __init__(self, bundles: list[ResourceBundle]):
        self.bundles = bundles
    
    async def load_template(self, name: str) -> str:
        # Load template from appropriate bundle
        
class CachingTemplateLoader:
    """Wrapper that adds caching to any loader."""
    
    def __init__(self, loader: TemplateLoader, cache_ttl: int = 300):
        self.loader = loader
        self.cache_ttl = cache_ttl
        self._cache = {}
```

### Usage Examples  

```python
# Basic usage
from provide.foundation.templates import AsyncTemplateEngine, FileTemplateLoader

loader = FileTemplateLoader([Path("templates"), Path("partials")])
engine = AsyncTemplateEngine(loader)

# Add custom functions
engine.add_global_function("format_date", lambda d: d.strftime("%Y-%m-%d"))

# Render single template
result = await engine.render("documentation.md", {
    "title": "API Docs",
    "components": components_data
})

# Render multiple templates in parallel
results = await engine.render_batch([
    ("api.md", api_context),
    ("guide.md", guide_context),
    ("reference.md", ref_context)
])

# Using with resource bundles  
from provide.foundation.discovery import ResourceDiscovery

discovery = ResourceDiscovery("*.templates")
bundles = discovery.discover_bundles(resource_type="documentation")

bundle_loader = BundleTemplateLoader(bundles)
cached_loader = CachingTemplateLoader(bundle_loader, cache_ttl=600)
engine = AsyncTemplateEngine(cached_loader)
```

### Features

1. **Async-First**: Built for high-performance parallel rendering
2. **Pluggable Loaders**: Multiple template source strategies
3. **Caching Layer**: Template compilation and content caching
4. **Metrics Integration**: Built-in performance monitoring
5. **Multiple Engines**: Support for Jinja2, Mako, etc.
6. **Partial Support**: Modular template composition

# With resilience patterns
from provide.foundation.resilience import RetryExecutor, CircuitBreaker

engine = AsyncTemplateEngine(
    loader=loader,
    retry_executor=RetryExecutor(...),
    circuit_breaker=CircuitBreaker(...)
)

# With streaming for large templates
async for chunk in engine.render_stream("large_template.html", context):
    # Process template chunks as they're rendered
    
# With template inheritance and includes
engine.add_template_path("base_templates/")
result = await engine.render("child_template.html", context)
```

### Benefits

# Guide: Authoring Plating Bundles

This guide provides a practical walkthrough for developers on how to create and maintain documentation, examples, and tests for their components using the `.plating` system.

## Step 1: Adorn Components with Templates

When you create a new component (e.g., a resource named `my_resource.py`), the first step is to create its documentation bundle using the `adorn` command.

Run the `adorn` command:
```bash
plating adorn --component-type resource
```
This command will find `my_resource.py` and, seeing it has no documentation template, create the following structure:
```
src/pyvider/components/resources/
├── my_resource.py
└── my_resource.plating/          # <-- Created
    ├── docs/
    │   └── my_resource.tmpl.md     # <-- Created
    └── examples/
        └── basic.tf                # <-- Created
```
The created files will contain standard boilerplate to get you started.

## Step 2: Populate the Documentation Template

Open the main template file, `my_resource.plating/docs/my_resource.tmpl.md`. This is where you write the primary documentation for your component.

-   **Update the Frontmatter**: Edit the `page_title` and `description` fields.
-   **Write the Introduction**: Add a clear, high-level description of what your component does.
-   **Use Template Functions**: The boilerplate will already contain `{{ example("basic") }}` and `{{ schema() }}`. These are essential and should be kept.

## Step 3: Write Meaningful Examples

Open `my_resource.plating/examples/basic.tf` and replace the placeholder content with a realistic, working example of your component. For components with multiple use cases, you can add more files (e.g., `advanced.tf`) and include them by name with `{{ example("advanced") }}`.

## Step 4: Plate and Verify Documentation

Once you have authored your documentation template and examples, run the `plate` command to generate the final documentation.

```bash
plating plate --output-dir docs/
```
This will create the final Markdown file (e.g., `docs/resources/my_resource.md`). Always review the generated file to ensure it looks correct.

## Step 5: Validate Documentation

After generating documentation, validate it for markdown quality:

```bash
plating validate --output-dir docs/
```

This will check your documentation for:
- Markdown linting errors
- Broken links
- Formatting issues
- Schema consistency

## Advanced: Grouped Examples

For comprehensive examples that demonstrate multiple components working together, you can create grouped examples:

### Creating Grouped Examples

Create subdirectories within your `examples/` folder:

```
my_resource.plating/examples/
├── basic.tf              # Simple flat example
└── full_stack/          # Grouped example directory
    └── main.tf          # Required entry point
```

### How Grouped Examples Work

1. **Discovery**: Plating finds all directories with `main.tf` files
2. **Compilation**: Examples from multiple components are combined
3. **Generation**: Creates:
   - `provider.tf` with required_providers block
   - Component-specific `.tf` files
   - `README.md` with terraform commands
4. **Fixtures**: Any fixtures in `fixtures/` are copied to the output

### Example Structure

```bash
# Multiple components contribute to the same group
resource1.plating/examples/full_stack/main.tf
resource2.plating/examples/full_stack/main.tf
data_source1.plating/examples/full_stack/main.tf

# Compiles to:
examples/full_stack/
├── provider.tf           # Auto-generated
├── resource1.tf          # From resource1
├── resource2.tf          # From resource2
├── data_source1.tf       # From data_source1
└── README.md            # Auto-generated with instructions
```

### Best Practices for Grouped Examples

1. **Use meaningful group names**: `full_stack`, `minimal`, `advanced`
2. **Always include main.tf**: Required for group discovery
3. **Add fixtures if needed**: Place test data in `fixtures/` directory
4. **Avoid filename conflicts**: Each component's files should be uniquely named

- `--quiet` - Suppress non-error output
- `--version` - Show version and exit
- `--help` - Show help message

## Auto-Detection Behavior

### Provider Name Auto-Detection

The CLI attempts to determine the provider name in this order:

### 1. Explicit Flag (Highest Priority)
```bash
plating adorn --provider-name my_provider
```

### 2. Configuration File
Checks `pyproject.toml` in the current directory:
```toml
[tool.plating]
provider_name = "my_provider"
```

### 3. Package Name Pattern
Extracts from package name if it follows conventions:
- `terraform-provider-{name}` → Provider: `{name}`
- `{name}-provider` → Provider: `{name}`

Example:
```toml
[project]
name = "terraform-provider-aws"  # Auto-detects: aws
```

### 4. Fallback
If none of the above work, you must specify `--provider-name`.

## Package Name Auto-Detection

Determines which package to search for components:

### 1. Explicit Flag (Highest Priority)
```bash
plating adorn --package-name pyvider.components
```

### 2. Current Directory's Package
Reads from `pyproject.toml`:
```toml
[project]
name = "pyvider.components"  # Auto-detected
```

### 3. Fallback Behavior
- If not specified: Searches ALL installed packages
- This can be slow for large environments
- Recommended: Always specify `--package-name` for better performance

## Output Directory Auto-Detection

### For `plating plate` Command

1. **Explicit Flag:**
```bash
plating plate --output-dir ./documentation
```

2. **Auto-Detection Logic:**
   - Searches for existing documentation directories in order of preference:
     1. `./docs/` - If the directory already exists
     2. `./documentation/` - If the directory already exists
     3. `./doc/` - If the directory already exists
   - If no existing directory is found, creates and uses `./docs/`

### For `plating validate` Command

Uses the same logic as `plate` to find where documentation was generated.

## Component Type Auto-Detection

### Default Behavior
If not specified, operations apply to ALL component types:
```bash
plating adorn  # Adorns resources, data_sources, and functions
```

### Explicit Selection
```bash
plating adorn --component-type resource
plating adorn --component-type resource --component-type function
```

## Project Root Auto-Detection

Determines the project root for relative paths:

### Detection Order:
1. **Explicit Flag:**
```bash
plating plate --project-root /path/to/project
```

2. **Git Repository Root:**
```python
# Walks up from current directory to find .git/
/path/to/project/.git/  # Found → project root is /path/to/project/
```

3. **Pyproject.toml Location:**
```python
# Walks up to find pyproject.toml
/path/to/project/pyproject.toml  # Found → project root is /path/to/project/
```

4. **Current Directory:**
```python
Path.cwd()  # Fallback if no indicators found
```

## Examples Directory Auto-Detection

### For Generated Examples
When using `--generate-examples`:

1. **Explicit Flags:**
```bash
plating plate --generate-examples \
  --examples-dir examples/ \
  --grouped-examples-dir examples/integration/
```

2. **Defaults:**
- Flat examples: `./examples/`
- Grouped examples: `./examples/`

## Auto-Detection in Action

### Minimal Command (Maximum Auto-Detection)
```bash
# In a properly configured project directory:
cd terraform-provider-mycloud
plating adorn    # Auto-detects everything
plating plate    # Auto-detects everything
```

### What Gets Auto-Detected:
- ✅ Provider name: `mycloud` (from package name)
- ✅ Package name: From pyproject.toml
- ✅ Output directory: `./docs/` (if exists)
- ✅ Component types: All types
- ✅ Project root: Git repository root

### When to Specify Values

Provide explicit values when:
1. Auto-detection fails or gives wrong results
2. Working outside a project directory
3. Wanting different behavior than defaults
4. Performance optimization (e.g., specific package)

### Full Explicit Command
```bash
plating adorn \
  --provider-name mycloud \
  --package-name pyvider.mycloud \
  --component-type resource \
  --output-dir ./templates/

plating plate \
  --provider-name mycloud \
  --package-name pyvider.mycloud \
  --output-dir ./docs/ \
  --component-type resource \
  --project-root /path/to/project/
```

## Configuration Precedence

From highest to lowest priority:

1. **Command-line flags** (always wins)
2. **Environment variables** (if implemented)
3. **pyproject.toml [tool.plating]** section
4. **Auto-detection** from context
5. **Built-in defaults**

## Debugging Auto-Detection

To see what values are being auto-detected:

```bash
# Verbose mode shows auto-detection process
plating adorn --verbose

# Debug logging for detailed information
plating plate --log-level DEBUG
```

Example output:
```
[DEBUG] Auto-detected provider name: mycloud
[DEBUG] Auto-detected package name: pyvider.mycloud
[DEBUG] Using output directory: ./docs/
[INFO] Starting adorn operation...
```

## Best Practices

### For Projects
1. **Configure in pyproject.toml:**
```toml
[tool.plating]
provider_name = "mycloud"
# Note: Other settings must use CLI flags
```

2. **Follow naming conventions:**
   - Package: `terraform-provider-{name}`
   - Or: `pyvider.{name}`

3. **Use standard directory structure:**
   - Documentation: `docs/`
   - Examples: `examples/`

### For CI/CD
Always use explicit flags in CI/CD to ensure reproducibility:
```yaml
- name: Generate Documentation
  run: |
    plating adorn --provider-name ${{ env.PROVIDER }} --package-name ${{ env.PACKAGE }}
    plating plate --provider-name ${{ env.PROVIDER }} --output-dir docs/
```

### For Development
Use auto-detection for convenience during development:
```bash
# Quick iterations during development
plating adorn && plating plate
```

## Limitations

Currently, only `provider_name` can be configured in `pyproject.toml`. Other settings like `output_dir`, `component_types`, and `package_name` for filtering must be provided as CLI flags.

Future versions may expand configuration file support.

    # Only process data sources
    print("Processing data sources...")
    data_result = await api.plate(
        component_types=[ComponentType.DATA_SOURCE]
    )
    print(f"Generated {data_result.files_generated} data source docs")

    # Process specific components by filtering
    registry = api.registry
    vpc_resources = [
        r for r in registry.get_components(ComponentType.RESOURCE)
        if "vpc" in r.name.lower()
    ]
    print(f"Found {len(vpc_resources)} VPC-related resources")

# Performance Guide

Optimize Plating performance for large providers and complex documentation workflows.

## Key Performance Features

- **Async Operations**: All I/O operations are asynchronous
- **Parallel Processing**: Templates render concurrently
- **Lazy Loading**: Bundles load on-demand
- **Schema Caching**: Schemas cached per session
- **Retry Policies**: Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- **Circuit Breakers**: Prevent cascading failures

## Optimization Strategies

### 1. Package-Specific Discovery

Always specify the package name to avoid searching all installed packages:

```python
# ✅ Fast - searches one package
api = Plating(context, package_name="pyvider.aws")

# ❌ Slow - searches all packages
api = Plating(context)
```

### 2. Component Type Filtering

Process specific component types to reduce scope:

```python
# Process only resources
result = await api.adorn(component_types=[ComponentType.RESOURCE])

# Process only what you need
await api.plate(component_types=[ComponentType.RESOURCE, ComponentType.DATA_SOURCE])
```

### 3. Parallel Template Rendering

Plating automatically renders templates in parallel:

```python
# Templates are rendered concurrently
result = await api.plate()  # All templates render in parallel

# Internal implementation uses asyncio.gather()
# for maximum concurrency
```

### 4. Batch Processing

For multiple providers, process them efficiently:

```python
import asyncio
from plating import Plating, PlatingContext

async def process_provider(provider_name: str):
    context = PlatingContext(provider_name=provider_name)
    api = Plating(context, package_name=f"pyvider.{provider_name}")
    return await api.plate()

async def process_all_providers():
    providers = ["aws", "azure", "gcp"]

    # Process providers in parallel
    results = await asyncio.gather(*[
        process_provider(p) for p in providers
    ])

    return results

asyncio.run(process_all_providers())
```

### 5. Memory Optimization

For providers with hundreds of components:

```python
async def process_large_provider():
    context = PlatingContext(provider_name="aws")
    api = Plating(context, package_name="pyvider.aws")

    # Process in chunks to manage memory
    component_types = [
        ComponentType.RESOURCE,
        ComponentType.DATA_SOURCE,
        ComponentType.FUNCTION
    ]

    for comp_type in component_types:
        # Process one type at a time
        await api.plate(component_types=[comp_type])

        # Let Python garbage collect between batches
        import gc
        gc.collect()
```

## Caching Strategies

### Schema Caching

Schemas are automatically cached per Plating instance:

```python
# Reuse the same api instance for multiple operations
api = Plating(context)

# Schema extracted once, reused for all operations
await api.adorn()   # Uses cached schema
await api.plate()   # Uses cached schema
await api.validate() # Uses cached schema
```

### Template Compilation Caching

Jinja2 templates are compiled and cached:

```python
# Templates compiled once per session
engine = AsyncTemplateEngine()

# Subsequent renders use compiled templates
await engine.render(bundle1, context1)  # Compiles template
await engine.render(bundle1, context2)  # Uses cached compilation
```

### Terraform Plugin Cache

Speed up schema extraction with plugin caching:

```bash
# Set plugin cache directory
export TF_PLUGIN_CACHE_DIR=$HOME/.terraform.d/plugin-cache

# Plating will reuse cached provider binaries
plating adorn
```

## Performance Monitoring

### Enable Metrics

Monitor operation performance:

```python
from provide.foundation import metrics

# Enable metrics collection
metrics.enable()

context = PlatingContext(
    provider_name="my_provider",
    log_level="INFO"
)

# Operations are automatically tracked
api = Plating(context)
result = await api.plate()

# Metrics available for:
# - adorn operations
# - plate operations
# - validate operations
# - template rendering
# - schema extraction
```

### Timing Operations

```python
import time

async def timed_operation():
    start = time.perf_counter()

    result = await api.plate()

    duration = time.perf_counter() - start
    print(f"Documentation generated in {duration:.2f}s")
    print(f"Files/second: {result.files_generated / duration:.1f}")
```

## Resilience Patterns

### Retry Policies

Built-in retry with exponential backoff:

```python
# Automatic retry configuration
retry_policy = RetryPolicy(
    max_attempts=3,
    backoff=BackoffStrategy.EXPONENTIAL,
    base_delay=0.5,
    max_delay=10.0
)

# Applied automatically to:
# - File I/O operations
# - Schema extraction
# - Network operations
```

### Circuit Breaker

Prevents cascading failures:

```python
# Circuit breaker opens after consecutive failures
# Prevents system overload
# Automatically resets after cooldown period
```

## Benchmarks

Typical performance metrics:

| Operation | Small Provider (10 components) | Medium (50 components) | Large (200+ components) |
|-----------|--------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| Discovery | < 0.5s | 1-2s | 3-5s |
| Adorn | < 1s | 2-3s | 5-10s |
| Plate | < 2s | 5-10s | 15-30s |
| Validate | < 1s | 2-3s | 5-10s |

## Performance Tuning

### 1. Optimize Template Complexity

Keep templates simple for faster rendering:

```jinja2
{# ✅ Fast - simple schema function #}
{{ schema() }}

{# ❌ Slow - complex nested loops #}
{% for item in items %}
  {% for subitem in item.subitems %}
    {% include complex_partial %}
  {% endfor %}
{% endfor %}
```

### 2. Minimize File I/O

```python
# ✅ Batch operations
result = await api.plate()  # Single batch operation

# ❌ Individual operations
for component in components:
    await process_component(component)  # Many small I/O operations
```

### 3. Use Appropriate Concurrency

```python
# Control concurrency level
import asyncio

# Limit concurrent tasks for resource-constrained environments
semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(10)

async def limited_task(item):
    async with semaphore:
        return await process_item(item)

results = await asyncio.gather(*[
    limited_task(item) for item in items
])
```

## Troubleshooting Performance

### Slow Discovery

```python
# Enable debug logging to see what's being searched
context = PlatingContext(
    provider_name="my_provider",
    log_level="DEBUG"
)

# Check which packages are being scanned
api = Plating(context)  # Watch debug output
```

### Template Rendering Bottlenecks

```python
# Profile template rendering
import cProfile
import pstats

async def profile_templates():
    profiler = cProfile.Profile()
    profiler.enable()

    await api.plate()

    profiler.disable()
    stats = pstats.Stats(profiler)
    stats.sort_stats('cumulative')
    stats.print_stats(10)  # Top 10 time consumers
```

### Memory Usage

```python
import tracemalloc

# Start tracing
tracemalloc.start()

# Run operations
await api.plate()

# Get memory snapshot
snapshot = tracemalloc.take_snapshot()
top_stats = snapshot.statistics('lineno')

# Print top memory consumers
for stat in top_stats[:10]:
    print(stat)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Specify package names** - Always provide package_name parameter
2. **Reuse API instances** - Create once, use multiple times
3. **Process by type** - Handle component types separately for large providers
4. **Enable plugin cache** - Set TF_PLUGIN_CACHE_DIR environment variable
5. **Monitor metrics** - Use foundation metrics for production
6. **Batch operations** - Use bulk operations over individual processing
7. **Profile first** - Measure before optimizing

## Environment Variables

Optimize with environment variables:

```bash
# Terraform plugin cache (speeds up schema extraction)
export TF_PLUGIN_CACHE_DIR=$HOME/.terraform.d/plugin-cache

# Python optimizations
export PYTHONOPTIMIZE=1

# Asyncio debug mode (development only)
export PYTHONASYNCIODEBUG=0  # Disable in production

# Memory limits (if needed)
ulimit -m 4194304  # 4GB memory limit
```

# Quick Start Guide

Get up and running with Plating in 5 minutes.

## Installation

Plating requires Python 3.11+ and uses UV for package management.

```bash
# Install UV (if not already installed)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Install Plating
git clone https://github.com/provide-io/plating.git
cd plating
uv sync
```

## Basic Usage

Plating follows a simple three-step workflow:

### 1. Adorn - Create Templates

Generate documentation templates for components that don't have them:

```bash
plating adorn --provider-name my_provider
```

This creates `.plating` bundles with template files for your components.

### 2. Plate - Generate Documentation

Transform templates into Terraform Registry-compliant documentation:

```bash
plating plate --output-dir docs/
```

### 3. Validate - Check Quality

Ensure generated documentation meets standards:

```bash
plating validate --output-dir docs/
```

## Python API Example

```python
import asyncio
from pathlib import Path
from plating import Plating, PlatingContext
from plating.types import ComponentType

async def generate_docs():
    # Initialize with context
    context = PlatingContext(
        provider_name="my_provider",
        log_level="INFO"
    )

    # Create API instance
    api = Plating(context, package_name="pyvider.components")

    # Step 1: Create templates for missing documentation
    adorn_result = await api.adorn(
        component_types=[ComponentType.RESOURCE]
    )
    print(f"✅ Created {adorn_result.templates_generated} templates")

    # Step 2: Generate documentation (with automatic validation)
    plate_result = await api.plate(
        output_dir=Path("docs"),
        validate_markdown=True  # Validates during generation
    )
    print(f"📄 Generated {plate_result.files_generated} files")

    # Optional: Run standalone validation if needed
    # validate_result = await api.validate(output_dir=Path("docs"))
    # print(f"✓ Validation: {validate_result.passed}/{validate_result.total} passed")

    return plate_result.success

# Run the async function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    success = asyncio.run(generate_docs())
    exit(0 if success else 1)
```

## Bundle Structure

Each component gets a `.plating` bundle:

```
my_resource.plating/
├── docs/
│   └── my_resource.tmpl.md    # Documentation template
├── examples/
│   └── basic.tf                # Usage examples
└── fixtures/
    └── data.json               # Test data (optional)
```

## Template Functions

In your `.tmpl.md` files, use these built-in functions:

```markdown
# my_resource

{{ example("basic") }}        <!-- Include examples/basic.tf -->

## Schema

{{ schema() }}                <!-- Generate schema table -->
```

## Next Steps

- [Author bundles](authoring-bundles.md) - Create custom documentation
- [CLI reference](cli-reference.md) - All command options
- [Complete examples](examples.md) - Real-world usage patterns
- [API reference](api-reference.md) - Full API documentation

## Common Commands

```bash
# Adorn specific component types
plating adorn --component-type resource --component-type data_source

# Generate with validation
plating plate --validate --force

# Filter to specific package
plating adorn --package-name pyvider.aws

# Show registry statistics
plating stats
```

# Registry Pattern

Plating uses a registry-based architecture for component discovery and management. This document explains how the registry works and how to interact with it.

## Overview

The PlatingRegistry is a centralized catalog of all components and their documentation bundles. It integrates with foundation's component discovery system to automatically find and register components.

## Architecture

```
PlatingRegistry
├── Component Discovery (via foundation.hub)
├── Bundle Registration (.plating directories)
├── Component Metadata (type, path, schema)
└── Statistics & Queries
```

## How It Works

### 1. Automatic Discovery

When you create a Plating instance, it automatically discovers components:

```python
from plating import Plating, PlatingContext

context = PlatingContext(provider_name="my_provider")
api = Plating(context, package_name="pyvider.components")

# Registry is automatically populated with discovered components
```

### 2. Component Registration

Components are registered by type and name:

```python
# Internal registration happens automatically
registry.register(
    name="my_resource",
    dimension="resource",  # or "data_source", "function", "provider"
    value=bundle_entry
)
```

### 3. Component Queries

The registry provides methods to query components:

```python
# Get all resources
resources = api.registry.get_components(ComponentType.RESOURCE)

# Get specific component
resource = api.registry.get_component(
    ComponentType.RESOURCE,
    "my_resource"
)

# Get components with templates
documented = api.registry.get_components_with_templates(
    ComponentType.RESOURCE
)
```

## Registry Statistics

Get insights into your provider's documentation:

```python
# Via API (synchronous method)
stats = api.get_registry_stats()

# Stats include:
# - Total components by type
# - Documentation coverage
# - Bundle statistics
```

CLI command:

```bash
plating stats --package-name pyvider.components
```

Example output:
```
📊 Registry Statistics
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Provider: my_provider
Package: pyvider.components

Components:
  Resources:     15 (12 documented)
  Data Sources:  8  (8 documented)
  Functions:     5  (3 documented)

Coverage: 80% (23/28)
```

## Component Types

The registry organizes components into dimensions:

| Type | Dimension | Directory | Description |
|------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| `ComponentType.RESOURCE` | "resource" | `resources/` | Terraform resources |
| `ComponentType.DATA_SOURCE` | "data_source" | `data-sources/` | Data sources |
| `ComponentType.FUNCTION` | "function" | `functions/` | Provider functions |
| `ComponentType.PROVIDER` | "provider" | `providers/` | Provider config |

## Bundle Discovery

The registry finds `.plating` bundles in installed packages:

```python
# Search pattern for bundles
package_name/
├── resources/
│   ├── my_resource.py
│   └── my_resource.plating/    # Discovered
├── data_sources/
│   └── my_data.plating/        # Discovered
└── functions/
    └── my_function.plating/     # Discovered
```

## Multi-Component Bundles

A single `.plating` directory can contain multiple component bundles:

```
components.plating/
├── resource1/
│   ├── docs/
│   └── examples/
├── resource2/
│   ├── docs/
│   └── examples/
└── data_source1/
    ├── docs/
    └── examples/
```

## Registry Entry Structure

Each registry entry contains:

```python
PlatingRegistryEntry:
  name: str                # Component name
  dimension: str           # Component type
  bundle: PlatingBundle    # Bundle instance
  metadata:
    path: Path            # Bundle directory path
    component_type: str   # Type identifier
    has_template: bool    # Has main template
    has_examples: bool    # Has example files
```

## Package Filtering

Control which packages are searched:

```python
# Search specific package only
api = Plating(context, package_name="pyvider.aws")

# Search all installed packages (slower)
api = Plating(context)  # package_name=None
```

## Registry Resilience

The registry includes foundation resilience patterns:

- **Retry Policy**: Automatic retries for discovery failures
- **Error Recovery**: Continues discovery even if some packages fail
- **Deduplication**: Prevents duplicate component registration
- **Caching**: Component metadata cached per session

## Programmatic Access

```python
import asyncio
from plating import Plating, PlatingContext
from plating.types import ComponentType

async def explore_registry():
    context = PlatingContext(provider_name="my_provider")
    api = Plating(context)

    # Get all resources
    resources = api.registry.get_components(ComponentType.RESOURCE)
    print(f"Found {len(resources)} resources")

    # Check specific component
    resource = api.registry.get_component(
        ComponentType.RESOURCE,
        "my_resource"
    )
    if resource:
        print(f"Resource path: {resource.plating_dir}")
        print(f"Has template: {resource.has_main_template()}")
        print(f"Has examples: {resource.has_examples()}")

    # Get registry statistics (synchronous method)
    stats = api.get_registry_stats()
    print(f"Total components: {stats['total_components']}")

    # Print stats by component type
    for comp_type in ['resource', 'data_source', 'function']:
        if comp_type in stats:
            print(f"{comp_type}: {stats[comp_type]['with_templates']}/{stats[comp_type]['total']} documented")

asyncio.run(explore_registry())
```

## Custom Discovery

For non-standard package structures, you can extend discovery:

```python
from plating.discovery import PlatingDiscovery

class CustomDiscovery(PlatingDiscovery):
    def discover_bundles(self):
        bundles = super().discover_bundles()
        # Add custom discovery logic
        return bundles
```

## Best Practices

1. **Package Organization**: Follow standard structure for automatic discovery
2. **Naming Conventions**: Use consistent naming for components and bundles
3. **Package Filtering**: Specify package_name for faster discovery
4. **Cache Registry**: Reuse Plating instance to avoid re-discovery

## Troubleshooting

### No Components Found

```python
# Enable debug logging
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

# Check discovery
context = PlatingContext(provider_name="my_provider", log_level="DEBUG")
api = Plating(context)
```

### Duplicate Components

The registry automatically deduplicates components during global discovery. If you see duplicates, check for multiple installations of the same package.

### Performance Issues

For large environments with many packages:

```python
# Always specify package name
api = Plating(context, package_name="specific.package")

# Avoid global discovery
# api = Plating(context)  # Searches all packages
```

# Troubleshooting Guide

This guide helps you resolve common issues when using Plating.

## Common Issues

### 1. "Module not found" Errors

**Problem:** ImportError when trying to import plating or pyvider packages.

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Ensure plating is installed
uv pip install -e .

# Install pyvider dependencies
uv pip install pyvider-cty provide-foundation
```

### 2. Async/Await Errors

**Problem:** "RuntimeWarning: coroutine was never awaited"

**Solution:** All Plating API methods are async and must be awaited:

```python
# ❌ Wrong
api.adorn()

# ✅ Correct
await api.adorn()

# Or wrap in async function
import asyncio
asyncio.run(main())
```

### 3. No Components Found

**Problem:** Plating doesn't find any components to document.

**Solutions:**

1. **Check package name:**
```python
# Specify the correct package
api = Plating(context, package_name="pyvider.components")
```

2. **Verify component discovery:**
```bash
# Check if components are registered
python -c "from provide.foundation.hub import Hub; hub = Hub(); hub.discover_components('pyvider.components'); print(hub.list_components())"
```

3. **Check component structure:**
- Ensure components are in correct directories (resources/, data_sources/, functions/)
- Verify components have proper naming (e.g., `my_resource.py`)

### 4. Template Rendering Fails

**Problem:** TemplateError during documentation generation.

**Common Causes:**
1. **Syntax error in template:**
   - Check for unmatched `{{` or `}}`
   - Verify Jinja2 syntax

2. **Missing example file:**
   ```jinja2
   {{ example("basic") }}  # Requires examples/basic.tf
   ```

3. **Schema not available:**
   - Ensure component has `get_schema()` method
   - Check schema extraction logs

### 5. File System Errors

**Problem:** FileSystemError when writing documentation.

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check permissions
ls -la docs/

# Create output directory
mkdir -p docs/resources docs/data-sources docs/functions

# Use --force flag to overwrite
plating plate --force
```

### 6. Provider Name Not Detected

**Problem:** "Could not determine provider name"

**Solutions:**

1. **Specify explicitly:**
```bash
plating adorn --provider-name my_provider
```

2. **Configure in pyproject.toml:**
```toml
[tool.plating]
provider_name = "my_provider"
```

3. **Follow naming convention:**
   - Package name: `terraform-provider-myname`
   - Or: `myname-provider`

### 7. Validation Failures

**Problem:** Documentation validation fails.

**Check:**
1. **Markdown syntax:**
   ```bash
   # Run linter directly
   pymarkdownlnt docs/
   ```

2. **Required sections:**
   - Ensure templates include required Terraform Registry sections
   - Check frontmatter format

3. **Schema formatting:**
   - Verify schema tables are properly formatted
   - Check for special characters in descriptions

### 8. Memory Issues with Large Providers

**Problem:** High memory usage or OOM errors.

**Solutions:**
1. **Process in batches:**
```python
# Process component types separately
await api.adorn(component_types=[ComponentType.RESOURCE])
await api.adorn(component_types=[ComponentType.DATA_SOURCE])
```

2. **Increase memory limit:**
```bash
# Set higher memory limit if needed
ulimit -m 4194304  # 4GB
```

### 9. Circuit Breaker Triggered

**Problem:** "Circuit breaker is open" errors.

**Cause:** Too many consecutive failures triggered the circuit breaker.

**Solution:**
```python
# Wait for circuit to reset (typically 60 seconds)
import time
time.sleep(60)

# Or restart the process
```

### 10. Template Functions Not Working

**Problem:** `{{ schema() }}` or `{{ example() }}` showing empty or error.

**Debug steps:**
1. **Check component has schema:**
```python
component = hub.get_component("resource", "my_resource")
schema = component.get_schema()
print(schema)
```

2. **Verify example file exists:**
```bash
ls my_resource.plating/examples/
```

3. **Check template context:**
```python
# Enable debug logging
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

## Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging to troubleshoot issues:

```python
# Python API
context = PlatingContext(
    provider_name="my_provider",
    log_level="DEBUG",
    verbose=True
)

# CLI
plating plate --verbose --log-level DEBUG
```

## Getting Help

If you encounter issues not covered here:

1. **Check the logs:** Look for error messages and stack traces
2. **Review examples:** Check the test files for usage patterns
3. **File an issue:** https://github.com/provide-io/plating/issues

### Issue Template

When reporting issues, include:
- Plating version (`plating --version`)
- Python version (`python --version`)
- Complete error message and stack trace
- Minimal reproducible example
- Operating system and environment

## Performance Optimization

### Slow Documentation Generation

**Optimize with:**
1. **Parallel processing:**
```python
# Use batch operations
result = await api.plate(component_types=[ComponentType.RESOURCE])
```

2. **Cache schemas:**
- Schemas are cached per session automatically
- Reuse the same Plating instance

3. **Limit scope:**
```bash
# Process specific components
plating plate --component-type resource
```

## Foundation Integration Issues

### Retry Policy Not Working

**Verify retry configuration:**
```python
# Check retry policy is active
api.retry_policy.max_attempts  # Should be 3
api.retry_policy.backoff  # Should be BackoffStrategy.EXPONENTIAL
```

### Metrics Not Collected

**Enable metrics collection:**
```python
from provide.foundation import metrics
metrics.enable()
```

## Environment Variables

Useful environment variables for debugging:

```bash
# Enable debug logging
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG

# Disable colored output
export NO_COLOR=1

# Set plugin cache (speeds up schema extraction)
export TF_PLUGIN_CACHE_DIR=$HOME/.terraform.d/plugin-cache
```

  Automatic .plating bundle creation for components.

# PlatingAdorner

The `PlatingAdorner` class automatically creates `.plating` directories for components that don't have documentation yet. It "adorns" components with the necessary bundle structure.

## Overview

The adorner automates the creation of plating bundles by:
1. Discovering components via pyvider hub
2. Finding components without existing bundles
3. Generating template documentation based on component metadata
4. Creating example Terraform configurations

## Features

- **Automatic Discovery**: Finds undocumented components
- **Template Generation**: Creates documentation templates from docstrings
- **Example Creation**: Generates basic Terraform examples
- **Batch Processing**: Adorns multiple components at once
- **Component Filtering**: Focus on specific component types

## Usage

### Adorn Missing Components

{{ example("basic") }}

### Adorn Specific Component Types

{{ example("filtered") }}

## Methods

### `adorn_missing(component_types: list[str] = None)`

Discovers and adorns all components without existing bundles.

**Parameters:**
- **component_types**: Optional list of types to process ("resource", "data_source", "function")

**Returns:** Dictionary with counts of adorned components by type

**Example:**
```python
results = await adorner.adorn_missing(["resource"])
print(f"Adorned {results['resource']} resources")
```

## Generated Structure

For each component, the adorner creates:

```
component_name.plating/
├── docs/
│   └── component_name.tmpl.md  # Generated template
└── examples/
    └── example.tf               # Basic example
```

## Template Generation

Templates are generated with:
- Component description from docstring
- Appropriate frontmatter
- Standard sections (Example Usage, Arguments, Attributes)
- Terraform import instructions (for resources)
- Schema placeholder

## Example Generation

Examples include:
- Basic resource/data source configuration
- Common required arguments
- Output declarations
- Best practice patterns

## Integration

The PlatingAdorner integrates with:
- **ComponentDiscovery**: For finding components
- **PlatingDiscovery**: For checking existing bundles
- **TemplateGenerator**: For creating content
- **ComponentFinder**: For locating source files

## CLI Usage

The adorner is available via CLI:

```bash
# Adorn all missing components
plating adorn

# Adorn only resources
plating adorn --component-type resource

# Adorn multiple types
plating adorn --component-type resource --component-type data_source
```

## Best Practices

1. **Review Generated Content**: Templates are starting points
2. **Enhance Examples**: Add real-world scenarios
3. **Document Edge Cases**: Include important warnings
4. **Maintain Consistency**: Follow documentation standards

## Error Handling

The adorner handles:
- Missing source files gracefully
- Invalid component types
- File system errors

# 🍲 Plating

> A sophisticated documentation generation system for Terraform/OpenTofu providers

Plating is a powerful documentation system that brings culinary elegance to technical documentation. Just as a chef carefully plates a dish, Plating helps you present your Terraform provider documentation beautifully.

## ✨ Features

- **🎯 Automatic Documentation Generation** - Generate comprehensive docs from your provider code
- **✨ Smart Component Adorning** - Automatically create documentation templates for undocumented components
- **🍽️ Beautiful Plating** - Render documentation with examples, schemas, and rich formatting
- **🔍 Component Discovery** - Automatically find and document resources, data sources, and functions
- **📝 Jinja2 Templates** - Flexible templating with custom functions and filters
- **🔄 Schema Integration** - Extract and format provider schemas automatically

## 📦 Installation

**Note:** Plating is currently in pre-release (v0.0.1000-0). Install from source:

```bash
# Clone and install from source
git clone https://github.com/provide-io/plating.git
cd plating
uv sync
```

**Coming soon to PyPI:**
```bash
# PyPI installation (not yet available)
# uv add plating
# pip install plating
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Adorn Your Components

First, create `.plating` bundles for your undocumented components:

```bash
# Adorn all missing components
plating adorn

# Adorn only resources
plating adorn --component-type resource
```

### 2. Customize Templates

Edit the generated templates in `.plating/docs/`:

```markdown
---
page_title: "Resource: my_resource"
---

# my_resource

Describe your resource here.

## Example Usage

\```terraform
resource "my_provider_my_resource" "example" {
  name = "example"
}
\```

## Schema

{{ "{{ schema() }}" }}
```

### 3. Generate Documentation

Render your documentation:

```bash
# Generate docs in ./docs directory
plating plate

# Custom output directory
plating plate --output-dir ./documentation
```

## 📂 Bundle Structure

Each component has a `.plating` bundle:

```
my_resource.plating/
├── docs/
│   ├── my_resource.tmpl.md    # Main template
│   └── _partial.md             # Reusable partials (optional)
└── examples/
    ├── basic.tf                # Example configurations
    └── advanced.tf             # (optional)
```

**Note:** The `examples/` directory can contain `.tf` files (for resources/data sources) or `.py` files (for Python API examples).

## 🎨 Template Functions

Plating provides powerful template functions:

- `{{ "{{ schema() }}" }}` - Render component schema as markdown table
- `{{ "{{ example('name') }}" }}` - Include an example file in a terraform code block
- `{{ "{{ include('filename') }}" }}` - Include a static partial file
- `{{ "{{ render('filename') }}" }}` - Render a dynamic template partial with current context

## ✅ Validation

Validate your generated documentation:

```bash
# Validate all documentation
plating validate

# Validate specific component types
plating validate --component-type resource
```

## 🔧 Configuration

Configure Plating in your `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[tool.plating]
# Provider name (auto-detected if not specified)
provider_name = "my_provider"
```

**Note:** Currently only `provider_name` can be configured in `pyproject.toml`. Other options like `output_dir` and `component_types` must be passed as CLI flags:

```bash
plating plate --output-dir docs --component-type resource
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

Plating follows a modular architecture:

- **PlatingBundle** - Represents documentation bundles
- **PlatingPlater** - Renders documentation
- **PlatingAdorner** - Creates documentation templates
- **PlatingDiscovery** - Finds components and bundles
- **SchemaProcessor** - Extracts provider schemas

# 4. TestInfoCommand - Test info output formatting
# 5. TestStatsCommand - Test stats output formatting
# 6. TestAutoDetectProviderName - Test provider name detection
# 7. TestErrorHandling - Test error scenarios and output
#
# Challenges:
# - Need proper async mocking for Click commands that use asyncio.run()
# - Need to mock Plating API and its async methods properly
# - Need to test output formatting with actual terminal colors/emojis
# - Click's CliRunner needs special handling for async commands
